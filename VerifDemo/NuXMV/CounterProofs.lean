  Proofs of Invariant Properties for the Counter Model
  =====================================================

  WHAT — The auto-generated `Counter.lean` defines a small NuXMV-style
         transition system (mode ∈ {off,on}, press : Bool, x : Nat ≤ 25)
         and stubs out three INVARSPEC theorems with `sorry`. Here we
         REPLACE those stubs with real proofs:
           inv1 :  x ≤ 10
           inv2 :  mode = off → x = 0
           inv3 :  x > 0    → mode = on

  HOW  — Mutual exclusion of these three properties alone is *not*
         enough to be inductive. We define a STRENGTHENED invariant
            counterInv s ≡  (s.x ≤ 10) ∧ (s.mode = off → s.x = 0)
         prove it inductive (init + step preservation), and then derive
         each individual INVARSPEC by `invariant_strengthening`.

  PROOF SHAPE — three steps:
    1. counterInv_init       — base case: invariant holds at start
    2. counterInv_step       — preserved by every transition
                               (case-split on mode, then on press, then on x<10)
    3. wrap into InductiveInvariant and read off each spec via strengthening

  TACTICS USED HERE — quick glossary:
    • intro / exact / refine / cases — see TransitionSystem.lean
    • by_cases h : P     — split into two branches (h : P) and (h : ¬P)
    • simp [hp] at h     — simplify h using hp as a rewrite rule + simp set
    • omega              — discharge linear-arithmetic goals over Nat / Int
    • absurd hp hnp      — from hp : P and hnp : ¬P, derive any goal
    • by decide          — Lean computes the answer for a decidable claim
    • cases hm : s.mode with | off => … | on => …
                         — split on s.mode, naming the equation as hm
                           (so subsequent `simp [hm]` substitutes mode=off, etc.)

/-- The strengthened invariant we'll prove inductive.
    Combines INVARSPEC 1 (`x ≤ 10`) with INVARSPEC 2 (`mode=off → x=0`).
    Neither holds inductively on its own; the conjunction does. -/
def counterInv (s : CounterState) : Prop :=
  s.x ≤ 10 ∧ (s.mode = .off → s.x = 0)

/-- BASE CASE: every initial state satisfies the strengthened invariant.
    Initial state has `mode = off` and `x = 0`, so both clauses are trivial. -/
theorem counterInv_init :
    ∀ s, CounterTS.init s → counterInv s := by
  intro s ⟨hm, hx⟩         -- destructure init: hm : mode = off, hx : x = 0
  constructor              -- split goal counterInv = "x ≤ 10 ∧ (mode=off → x=0)" into two parts
  · simp [hx]              -- first part: x ≤ 10. Substitute hx (x = 0) and simp closes it.
  · intro _; exact hx      -- second part: assume mode=off (anonymous), conclude x=0 directly via hx

/-- INDUCTIVE STEP: the strengthened invariant is preserved by every transition.
    The big case-split tree:  mode=off / on  →  press=true / false  →  (when on, !press) x<10 / x≥10.
    `simp [...] at ...` reduces the if-then-else encoded transition to a single
    equation per branch; then we discharge with `omega` or by direct rewriting. -/
